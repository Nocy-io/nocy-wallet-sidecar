# Sidecar Implementation Audit Report

This document records the audit of the `nocy-wallet-feed` sidecar against the upstream Midnight repositories to verify correctness and alignment.

## Repositories Audited

- `./repositories/midnight-indexer` - Chain/wallet indexer and API
- `./repositories/midnight-ledger` - Ledger event types and SDK
- `./repositories/midnight-node` - Node runtime and block structure

---

## 1. Data Ordering Consistency

### Upstream Behavior
- **Blocks**: Fetched sequentially with parent hash validation; ordered by height
- **Transactions**: Ordered by `transactions.id` within a block
- **Ledger Events**: Ordered by `ledger_events.id` within a transaction

### Sidecar Implementation
**Status: ALIGNED**

- Blocks fetched via `get_blocks_in_range()` with `ORDER BY height ASC`
- Feed items sorted by `(tx_id, ledger_event_id)` before assembly
- `SortableFeedItem` wrapper ensures consistent ordering
- Block bundles are contiguous (validated with gap detection)

**Reference**: [routes/feed.rs:349-352](src/routes/feed.rs#L349-L352)
```rust
sortable_items.sort_by(|a, b| {
    a.tx_id.cmp(&b.tx_id).then(a.ledger_event_id.cmp(&b.ledger_event_id))
});
```

## 2. WalletReadyHeight Gating

### Upstream Behavior
- Wallet indexer tracks `wallets.last_indexed_transaction_id`
- Processes transactions sequentially starting from `last_indexed + 1`
- Emits `WalletIndexed` event after saving relevant transactions

### Sidecar Implementation
**Status: ALIGNED**

- `compute_wallet_ready_height()` finds first block with `regular_transactions.id > last_indexed`
- Returns `height - 1` as the ready height (ready up to the block before blocking tx)
- Handles edge cases: NULL last_indexed treated as 0, missing wallet returns NotFound
- Feed returns empty blocks if `from_height > wallet_ready_height`

**Reference**: [db.rs:103-160](src/db.rs#L103-L160)

---

## 3. Full History Completeness

### Upstream Behavior
- Shielded: `relevant_transactions` table links wallets to transactions
- Unshielded: `unshielded_utxos` table tracks creates and spends by owner
- Dust: `ledger_events` with `grouping = 'Dust'`
- Global Nullifiers: All `ZswapInput` events, not just relevant txs

### Sidecar Implementation
**Status: ALIGNED**

Feed includes all required data types:
1. **ShieldedRelevantTx**: Relevant transactions with zswap events and contract actions
2. **ZswapInputRaw**: Raw bytes from ALL ZswapInput events for client-side nullifier extraction
3. **DustLedgerEvent**: Dust events filtered by session's dust public key
4. **UnshieldedDelta**: Creates (+) and spends (-) for registered addresses

**Reference**: [routes/feed.rs:242-244](src/routes/feed.rs#L242-L244)
```rust
// Fetch ALL zswap input events for global nullifiers (not just relevant txs)
let global_zswap_inputs =
    get_all_zswap_input_events_in_range(&state.db_pool, from_height, to_height).await?;
```

## 4. Nullifier Streaming (Raw Bytes)

### Upstream Behavior (midnight-ledger + midnight-indexer)
- Events use tagged serialization: `"event[v6]"` with `EventDetailsV6`
- Chain indexer stores raw bytes via `event.tagged_serialize_v6()` (see `indexer-common/src/domain/ledger/ledger_state.rs:378-380`)
- `ZswapInput { nullifier: CoinNullifier, contract: Option<ContractAddress> }`
- Nullifier is 32-byte persistent hash derived from coin info + sender evidence

### Sidecar Implementation
**Status: ALIGNED (Raw Pass-through)**

The sidecar passes through raw ZswapInput event bytes without server-side parsing:
- Queries `ledger_events.raw` for ZswapInput events directly from upstream tables
- Hex-encodes raw bytes and sends as `zswapInputRaw` feed items
- Client parses raw bytes using midnight-ledger SDK to extract nullifiers

**Spend Detection Approaches**:
1. **Global nullifier streaming** (default): Client receives all `zswapInputRaw` events, parses with midnight-ledger SDK
2. **0-value change outputs**: Client uses wallet-side spend detection, disables streaming via `includeNullifiers=false`

**Control Flow**:
- `includeNullifiers` query param (default: `true`) overrides session preference
- Session preference `nullifierStreaming` stored in `nocy_sidecar.session_profile`
- When disabled, DB query is skipped entirely for performance

**Reference**:
- ZswapInputRaw struct: [feed.rs:113-127](src/feed.rs#L113-L127)
- Feed assembly: [routes/feed.rs:264-306](src/routes/feed.rs#L264-L306)
- Upstream serialization: `indexer-common/src/domain/ledger/ledger_state.rs:378-380`

## 5. Reorg Handling

### Upstream Behavior (midnight-node)
- Uses Substrate's GRANDPA finality
- Blocks not finalized may be reverted
- Parent hash chain must be continuous

### Sidecar Implementation
**Status: ALIGNED**

Implements comprehensive reorg detection:
1. **Height gap detection**: Checks for missing blocks in sequence
2. **Parent hash mismatch**: Compares block N+1's parent_hash to block N's hash
3. **Boundary detection**: Fetches previous block hash for first block in batch
4. **Reset signaling**: Emits `ControlEvent::ResetRequired` with safe restart height

**Reference**: [routes/feed.rs:134-207](src/routes/feed.rs#L134-L207)
```rust
// For boundary reorg detection: fetch the previous block's hash if from_height > 0
let boundary_prev_hash: Option<String> = if from_height > 0 {
    get_block_hash_at_height(&state.db_pool, from_height - 1).await?
} else {
    None
};
```

## 6. Session Management

### Upstream Behavior
- `connect(viewingKey)` derives session_id from viewing key
- Session tracked in `wallets` table with encrypted viewing key
- `last_indexed_transaction_id` tracks indexing progress

### Sidecar Implementation
**Status: ALIGNED**

- Bootstrap proxies to upstream indexer for session creation
- Profile stored in `nocy_sidecar.session_profile` (dust key only, no viewing key)
- Unshielded addresses stored in `nocy_sidecar.session_unshielded_address`
- Keepalive maintains wallet activity in upstream

---

## 7. Event Types for Ledger SDK

### Required by SDK
The ledger SDK needs events to:
1. Update Merkle tree with commitments (ZswapOutput)
2. Remove spent coins via nullifiers (ZswapInput)
3. Track dust generation lifecycle
4. Maintain unshielded balance

### Sidecar Provides
1. **ZswapInputRaw**: Raw event bytes for client-side nullifier extraction and spend detection
2. **ShieldedRelevantTx.zswap_events**: Raw event bytes for full event replay
3. **DustLedgerEvent**: Raw dust events for local processing
4. **UnshieldedDelta**: Balance changes for unshielded addresses

**Note**: The sidecar provides raw event bytes, allowing clients to deserialize and replay events using the midnight-ledger SDK directly. Nullifier extraction is performed client-side.

## Recommendations

1. **Finalized Height**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - The upstream chain-indexer only subscribes to finalized blocks via `subscribe_finalized()`, meaning all blocks in the database are finalized. `finalizedHeight` now equals `chainHead` in watermarks.

2. **Event Ordering**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Added `validate_event_ordering()` function that detects gaps in `ledger_event_id` sequences within transactions. Gaps are logged with warnings and recorded via the `event_ordering_anomalies_total` Prometheus metric (with `type=ledger_event_gap` label).

3. **Client SDK Version**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Added "SDK Compatibility" section to API.md documenting `@midnight/ledger ^6.1.0` (JS/TS) and `midnight-ledger ^6.1.0` (Rust) requirements, including code examples for parsing raw event bytes and a protocol version compatibility matrix.

## Optional Fundamental Improvements (Resilience)

These are optional, more fundamental changes that further reduce the chance of merkle readiness stalls
by removing or shrinking reliance on large object store reads in the hot path:

1. **Persist snapshot metadata in Postgres**: Have the chain-indexer store `(block_height, highest_zswap_state_index, protocol_version)` per finalized block, so the sidecar can derive readiness without pulling the full ledger state object.
2. **Precompute collapsed merkle updates upstream**: Generate and store collapsed updates during indexing, then serve prebuilt ranges to the sidecar and SDK clients.
3. **Chunked object store reads with resume**: Replace full-object reads with chunked fetch + resume, reducing the chance that a single stalled read blocks readiness.
